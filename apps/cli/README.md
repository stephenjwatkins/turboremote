## Getting Started

Turboremote is a standalone, frictionless Remote Cache provider for Turborepo. You can be connected in less than a minute.

To get started, run the below command at the root of your Turborepo:

```sh
npx turboremote link
```

You'll be asked for your email address and a team name to associate with your account. After that, Turboremote will seamlessly connect with your Turborepo project.

To view the full list of available commands, run:

```sh
npx turboremote --help
```

You can restore previous Remote Cache settings, manage team members, create access tokens for CI, and more.
